                            Working out what living expenses you will need to consider and how much they will cost you will depend on so many factors. For example, if you want to live the lifestyle you have in Sri Lanka, it will be expensive, therefore, would require some compromises. 
                            As a rough guide, accommodation and other living expenses (e.g. food, travel, etc) will be approximately between GBP 100 to GBP 200 per week depending on the area you select to stay.
